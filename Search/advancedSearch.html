<!--
    the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
        Find pages with… “all these words:”
        Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
        Find pages with… “any of these words:”
        Find pages with… “none of these words:”
    the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.
    Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text.
    When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to the search results page for their given query.
